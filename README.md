This MATLAB script demonstrates a comprehensive image processing pipeline, beginning with the introduction of two distinct noise types—Gaussian and salt-and-pepper—into an original image. The Gaussian noise is added using the `imnoise` function with a specified mean of zero and a variance of 0.01, simulating common real-world distortions caused by sensor noise. To mitigate this, the script applies Gaussian filtering using the `fspecial` function to generate a 5x5 filter kernel with a standard deviation of 2, followed by convolution with the noisy image through `imfilter`. In parallel, salt-and-pepper noise, with a density of 0.02, is introduced to the original image, after which a median filter, with a 3x3 window applied to the grayscale version of the noisy image using `medfilt2`, is utilized for noise reduction. The performance of the filtering techniques is quantitatively evaluated using both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics, which measure the distortion introduced by noise and the quality of the filtered output, respectively. The filtered images, along with their corresponding MSE and PSNR values, are displayed in a side-by-side comparison in a series of subplots for visual and quantitative analysis, facilitating a clear assessment of the efficacy of each noise reduction method.
